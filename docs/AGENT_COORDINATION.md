# Agent Coordination System

Open-Deep-Coder implements an advanced multi-agent coordination system that orchestrates specialized agents to perform complex development tasks through intelligent task routing and workflow management.

## Overview

The agent coordination system manages multiple specialized agents working together to accomplish development tasks:
- **Orchestrator** - Central coordination and state management
- **Planner** - Task analysis and decomposition
- **Implementer** - Code generation and modification
- **Verifier** - Testing and quality assurance
- **Reviewer** - Security and code review
- **Researcher** - Documentation and best practices lookup

## Architecture

### Agent Roles

#### Orchestrator
- Maintains system state and agent coordination
- Routes tasks to appropriate agents
- Manages workflow execution
- Handles error recovery and fallback strategies

#### Planner
- Analyzes requirements and project context
- Breaks down complex tasks into atomic operations
- Creates implementation plans with clear steps
- Prioritizes tasks based on dependencies and importance

#### Implementer
- Generates and modifies code based on plans
- Integrates with LLMs for intelligent code generation
- Applies code transformations and refactorings
- Ensures code quality and consistency

#### Verifier
- Runs tests and quality checks
- Performs static analysis and linting
- Validates code against requirements
- Reports issues and suggests improvements

#### Reviewer
- Performs security analysis
- Conducts code quality reviews
- Checks compliance with best practices
- Generates review comments and suggestions

#### Researcher
- Looks up documentation and tutorials
- Finds relevant code examples
- Researches best practices and patterns
- Provides context and guidance

### Communication Protocol

Agents communicate through a standardized protocol:
- **Task Messages** - Request and response format
- **Status Updates** - Progress and state reporting
- **Error Handling** - Exception and failure management
- **Context Sharing** - Data and state exchange

## Features

### Task Management
- Priority-based task queuing
- Dependency tracking and resolution
- Load balancing across agents
- Performance monitoring and optimization

### Workflow Orchestration
- Multi-step workflow execution
- Conditional branching and logic
- Parallel task execution
- Error handling and recovery

### Performance Monitoring
- Agent utilization tracking
- Task completion metrics
- Success rate analysis
- Performance bottleneck identification

### Dynamic Scaling
- Agent pool management
- Load-based scaling decisions
- Resource allocation optimization
- Failure detection and recovery

## API Endpoints

The frontend communicates with the agent coordination system through these backend endpoints:

- `GET /api/coordination/status` - Get coordination system status
- `POST /api/coordination/task` - Submit a task for execution
- `POST /api/coordination/workflow` - Submit a workflow for execution
- `GET /api/agents/{agent_type}/status` - Get specific agent status
- `POST /api/agents/{agent_type}/run` - Run a specific agent
- `POST /api/agents/stop` - Stop all agents

## Task Lifecycle

### Task Submission
1. Task is submitted through API
2. Orchestrator validates and prioritizes task
3. Task is queued for execution
4. Appropriate agent is selected

### Task Execution
1. Agent receives task assignment
2. Agent processes task and updates status
3. Progress is reported to orchestrator
4. Results are returned upon completion

### Task Completion
1. Results are validated and processed
2. Success metrics are updated
3. Dependencies are resolved
4. Next tasks are scheduled

## Security Considerations

Agent coordination includes several security measures:

### Access Control
- Role-based permissions for agent operations
- Authentication for API endpoints
- Secure communication between components
- Audit logging for all agent activities

### Task Validation
- Input validation for all task parameters
- Sanitization of user-provided data
- Protection against malicious task injection
- Resource usage limits and monitoring

### Error Handling
- Secure error reporting
- Prevention of information leakage
- Graceful degradation on failures
- Recovery mechanisms for critical errors

## Performance Optimization

### Load Balancing
- Dynamic task distribution
- Agent capability matching
- Resource utilization monitoring
- Bottleneck identification and resolution

### Caching
- Frequently accessed data caching
- Computation result caching
- Configuration caching
- Performance metric caching

### Resource Management
- Memory usage optimization
- CPU utilization monitoring
- Network communication efficiency
- Storage optimization

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Agent not responding**
   - Check agent process status
   - Verify communication channels
   - Review agent logs for errors
   - Restart affected agents

2. **Task execution delays**
   - Check agent load and utilization
   - Review task queue status
   - Monitor resource usage
   - Optimize task dependencies

3. **Workflow failures**
   - Review workflow configuration
   - Check individual task results
   - Analyze error logs and stack traces
   - Validate input parameters

### Monitoring and Diagnostics

Enable detailed logging for troubleshooting:
```bash
# Set environment variable
export AGENT_DEBUG=true
```

Monitor agent performance:
```bash
# Use built-in monitoring endpoints
curl http://localhost:8000/api/coordination/status
```

## Extending the System

To add new agent types:

1. **Define Agent Interface**
   - Implement standard agent methods
   - Define task handling logic
   - Set up status reporting

2. **Register with Orchestrator**
   - Add agent to agent registry
   - Configure communication channels
   - Set up monitoring and logging

3. **Integrate with Frontend**
   - Add agent to status display
   - Create task submission interface
   - Implement result visualization

## Best Practices

### Task Design
- Keep tasks focused and atomic
- Define clear success criteria
- Include comprehensive error handling
- Provide detailed progress reporting

### Workflow Design
- Minimize task dependencies
- Use parallel execution where possible
- Implement proper error recovery
