# Security Guidelines

## Security Checklist (Minimum Requirements)

Before any code is merged, the following security requirements must be met:

### 🔐 Secrets and Credentials
- [ ] No secrets, API keys, or credentials committed to the repository
- [ ] All sensitive configuration uses environment variables
- [ ] `.gitignore` properly excludes sensitive files (`.env`, etc.)

### 📦 Dependencies
- [ ] All dependencies are pinned with specific versions
- [ ] Dependencies are from trusted sources
- [ ] Regular dependency vulnerability scanning is enabled
- [ ] Unused dependencies are removed

### 🛡️ Input Validation
- [ ] All user inputs are properly validated and sanitized
- [ ] SQL injection protection in place (if applicable)
- [ ] XSS protection implemented (if web-facing)
- [ ] File upload restrictions and validation (if applicable)

### 📝 Logging and Monitoring
- [ ] Logging avoids sensitive data (passwords, tokens, PII)
- [ ] Error messages don't expose internal system details
- [ ] Audit trails for security-relevant actions

### ⚖️ Legal and Compliance
- [ ] All licenses are respected and documented
- [ ] Third-party code is noted in NOTICE file
- [ ] No GPL code in proprietary projects (unless intended)
- [ ] Attribution requirements met

### 🔒 Code Security
- [ ] No hardcoded passwords or tokens
- [ ] Proper error handling (no sensitive data in stack traces)
- [ ] Secure random number generation where needed
- [ ] Cryptographic operations use established libraries

## Security Scanning

### Automated Scans
- **Dependencies:** `pip-audit` or `safety` for Python packages
- **Secrets:** `detect-secrets` or similar tools
- **Code Quality:** Static analysis with security rules enabled

### Manual Review
- Review all network communications
- Validate authentication and authorization logic
- Check for common security anti-patterns
- Verify secure defaults are used

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please:

1. **Do NOT** create a public issue
2. Email security concerns to: [security@example.com]
3. Include detailed steps to reproduce
4. Allow reasonable time for response before disclosure
