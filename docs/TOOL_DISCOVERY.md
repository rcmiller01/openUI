# Tool Discovery and Management System

Open-Deep-Coder implements a comprehensive tool discovery and management system that provides a unified interface for accessing capabilities across multiple integration systems including LSP, MCP, n8n, debugging, and native tools.

## Overview

## Architecture

### Tool Registry
Centralized tool database that:
- Maintains metadata for all tools
- Tracks tool availability and status
- Manages tool categories and capabilities
- Handles tool versioning and updates

### Discovery Mechanism
Automatic tool discovery through:
- Integration system scanning
- Dynamic registration
- Health checking
- Capability reporting

### Invocation Layer
Unified tool invocation interface that:
- Routes calls to appropriate integration systems
- Handles parameter validation and transformation
- Manages error handling and recovery
- Provides consistent response format

### Analytics Engine
Usage tracking and analysis:
- Tool usage statistics
- Performance metrics
- Popular tool combinations
- Usage pattern analysis

## Features

### Dynamic Discovery
- Automatic detection of new tools
- Real-time tool status updates
- Integration system monitoring
- Health check and failure detection

### Unified Interface
- Consistent API across all tool types
- Standardized parameter format
- Uniform response structure
- Error handling abstraction

### Capability-Based Routing
- Tool selection based on required capabilities
- Load balancing across similar tools
- Fallback mechanism for unavailable tools
- Performance-based routing decisions

### Usage Analytics
- Detailed usage tracking
- Performance monitoring
- Trend analysis
- Reporting and visualization

## API Endpoints

The frontend communicates with the tool discovery system through these backend endpoints:

- `GET /api/tools` - Get all available tools
- `GET /api/tools/{category}` - Get tools by category
- `POST /api/tools/invoke` - Invoke a specific tool
- `GET /api/tools/analytics` - Get tool usage analytics
- `GET /api/tools/search` - Search tools by name or capability

## Tool Lifecycle

### Registration
1. Integration system reports available tools
2. Tool metadata is validated and stored
3. Tool is added to appropriate categories
4. Availability status is set

### Discovery
1. System scans integration systems
2. New tools are identified
3. Tool metadata is retrieved
4. Tools are registered in the system

### Invocation
1. Tool is selected based on requirements
2. Parameters are validated and prepared
3. Call is routed to appropriate integration system
4. Results are processed and returned

### Monitoring
1. Tool usage is tracked
2. Performance metrics are collected
3. Availability is monitored
4. Issues are detected and reported

## Security Considerations

Tool discovery includes several security measures:

### Access Control
- Permission-based tool access
- Authentication for tool invocation
- Role-based access control
- Audit logging for all tool usage

### Input Validation
- Parameter validation for all tool calls
- Sanitization of user input
- Protection against injection attacks
- Resource usage limits

### Tool Isolation
- Sandboxing for external tools
- Limited file system access
- Restricted network communication
- Resource monitoring and limits

## Performance Optimization

### Caching
- Tool metadata caching
- Frequently accessed tool results
- Capability mapping cache
- Analytics data aggregation

### Load Balancing
- Distribution of tool calls
- Integration system load monitoring
- Performance-based routing
- Failover mechanisms

### Resource Management
- Memory usage optimization
- Connection pooling
- Concurrent operation limits
- Resource cleanup and garbage collection

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Tools not appearing**
   - Check integration system status
   - Verify tool registration process
   - Review system logs for errors
   - Restart affected integration systems

2. **Tool invocation failures**
   - Validate tool parameters
   - Check tool availability status
   - Review integration system connectivity
   - Examine error logs and stack traces

3. **Performance issues**
   - Monitor tool usage patterns
   - Check resource utilization
   - Review caching effectiveness
   - Optimize tool invocation frequency

### Monitoring and Diagnostics

Enable detailed logging for troubleshooting:
```bash
# Set environment variable
export TOOL_DEBUG=true
```

Monitor tool usage:
```bash
# Use built-in analytics endpoints
curl http://localhost:8000/api/tools/analytics
```

## Extending the System

To add support for new tool types:

1. **Create Integration Handler**
   - Implement tool discovery interface
   - Add tool invocation logic
   - Set up status monitoring
   - Register with tool discovery manager

2. **Define Tool Metadata**
   - Specify tool capabilities
   - Define parameter schemas
   - Set up category mapping
   - Configure availability checks

3. **Integrate with Frontend**
   - Add tool to discovery interface
   - Create invocation UI
   - Implement result visualization
   - Add to analytics dashboard

## Best Practices
